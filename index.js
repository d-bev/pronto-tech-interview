/*
PROBLEM PART #2:

Design a webpage to display the calculated metrics from Part 1.

You are free to use any technology in your toolbox to implement this (Pronto mostly uses React)
Since the number of unique name isn't fixed, display the top 10 sorted by maximum 'measurement', descending. 
Display all the key metrics as explained in Part 1, along with the number of datapoints that each name has been calculated over.

BONUS PROBLEM:

Visualize a name as its Latitude Longitude Heading change. 
    - Animate a sprite as these values change 
    - Design and implementation completely up to you. 
    - Not doing this portion is not a penalty in anyway, but be prepared to explain approaches that you might take to implement this.
