META / PLANNING:

If frontend is going to spam back-end with GET requests:
    put the GET request function on a timer
    make the backend function run once per GET request
    have this data display on the webpage
    implement logic within the frontend to handle the 'top 10' portion of the problem:
        "Display the top 10 sorted by maximum 'measurement', descending."

IDEAS:
    make the frontend a REACT app

        have the backend run continuously and constantly update its nested dict
        use REACT hooks to handle the constant updates made to the nested dict
            have some code on the backend that more or less does:

        OR 

        have the backend run continuously and constantly spit the entries it makes at the frontend
        use REACT hooks to update the state with the constant stream of info

    maintain the same structure that I have



TASKS:

    have backend actually display data on the frontend that's coming from the server
